# energy-market-machine-learning
A researche study on the problem of Energy Market's Demand Side Management (DSM) using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

Here we research on the user-friendly DSM techniques for a smart home community. We first entice the community with an incentive mechanism to form a trad-
ing group and consider this scenario as partially observable Markov Games. Then we propose a ?????????????????? framework to address the large-scale energy cost optimization problem.


## RL Basics

The theory of RL is founded on two important principles: Bellman's equation and the theory of stochastic approximation.

Any RL model contains 4 basic elements:
1- System Environment (Simulation Model)
2- Learning Agent(s) (market participants)
3- Set of Actions for each Agent (Action Spaces)
4- System Response (participant Rewards)
